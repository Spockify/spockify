If you are interested in 02/26 poster night please e-mail me your poster by
Monday (02/22) and I will print it out for you; the poster board is also
available for you (this will also be used for the NYCSEF contest if you
have applied).

Honestly, I am disappointed in the lack of responses to poster night,
as well as in past messages I have sent your way.

Again, if you need me to print out a poster for either of the two events
mentioned above the deadline is 02/22 by 5:00 pm, otherwise you are
on your own.

I hope you are enjoying the break and certainly hope there is enough
interest in poster night; it's been quite successful in the past years.

Econome

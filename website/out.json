NHEC covers all costs to attend. The Institute\r\nwill be held and students housed/fed at Wagner College in Staten Island.\r\n\r\nThis is one of 3 Environmental STEM Institutes (NM, CA, NY) NHEC operates\r\nacross the country as we work to build the next generation of\r\nLatino/minority environmental professionals and scientists. Interested\r\nstudents should apply promptly for this unique opportunity.\r\n\r\nRegarding eligibility: as this is regional program the Institute is open to\r\nstudents from the NYC area; states in the Northeastern U.S.; and other\r\nstates in reasonable proximity to NY.\r\n\r\nThe NYC Institute is an intensive, residential, science-based, 8 day long\r\nenvironmental education and envir. career program for top students, aged\r\n17-19 (typically high school seniors and freshmen/sophomores in college)\r\ndeeply interested in the environment and a related major/career. There is\r\nalso a job component to this program, outlined below.\r\n\r\nThrough a full scholarship, NHEC covers ALL costs for students\r\ncompetitively selected, including transportation, housing, meals, science\r\nequipment, and more.\r\n\r\nUsing an Environmental STEM curriculum students learn a range of\r\nenvironmental and conservation issues. Students also conduct Environmental\r\nField Studies (air, soil, water testing, biological assessments, birding,\r\nmore) using high-tech science equipment. Also participating are volunteer\r\n=E2=80=9Crole models=E2=80=9D-environmental professionals, many minority an=\r\nd from the\r\nsciences=E2=80=94who engage/inspire students to pursue an\r\nenvironmental/conservation career.\r\n\r\nThe major sponsor for the NYC Institute is the U.S. Forest Service, Eastern\r\nRegion, with support from the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service.\r\nThus students also learn about federal internships and youth jobs with\r\nthese agencies and others, and how to apply.\r\n\r\nJOBS: like the last 3 years the US Forest Service is offering PAID FEDERAL\r\nJOBS FOR THIS SUMMER to qualified Institute students!! Students (must be\r\n18) will work in the Youth Conservation Corps. FS staff will be on-site to\r\nconduct interviews. Those hired into YCC will work July-August at one of 5\r\nnational forests. If hired, free housing is provided. Students will do a\r\nrange of highly educational, hands-on environmental and science work =E2=80=\r\n=9Cin\r\nthe field=E2=80=9D.\r\n\r\nSo if you are passionate about the environment, enjoy science, have a\r\nminimum 3.0 GPA, AND been seeking a job in the enviro arena, this program\r\nis for you.\r\n\r\nThe attached contain all materials for students to apply, including details\r\non eligibility/selection and YCC job criteria. Please read the Fact Sheet\r\nfirst; it has a full overview of the program.\r\n\r\nTo address two FAQ=E2=80=99s: 1. there is no deadline per se; NHEC reviews\r\napplications/selects students on a rolling basis until all slots are\r\nfilled. But students are strongly urged to apply asap. And 2. as this is a\r\nfederally funded program eligibility is limited to U.S. Citizens and\r\nPermanent Legal Residents.\r\n\r\nLastly, we ask you to forward this email to those who might be interested\r\nin this exciting program, including qualified students, fellow educators,\r\nhigh schools, colleges, youth organizations, and more.

Pediatric\r\noncology is a rapidly evolving field. Dr. Dela Cruz finds it both humbling\r\nand gratifying when he helps patients and families navigate through those\r\nfirst several weeks after a cancer diagnosis and at the beginning of\r\ntherapy. He also enjoys the long-term follow-up that he has with patients\r\nand their families as they complete treatment and resume their lives.\r\n\r\nIn addition to caring for patients, Dr. Dela Cruz conducts research in the\r\narea of pediatric solid tumors. Specifically, his research efforts are\r\nfocused on understanding the biology of sarcomas. Dr. Dela Cruz has been\r\ndeveloping cell models to understand the development of this heterogeneous\r\ngroup of tumors, with the hope of identifying novel targets to treat these\r\ntumors, which are exceedingly difficult to treat once they have\r\nmetastasized.\r\n\r\nDr. Dela Cruz is working to validate a relatively novel approach to\r\ntreating sarcomas by re-instituting a maturation program in sarcoma cells\r\n(since these and many other solid cancers are characterized by an arrest in\r\nnormal maturation) through a process called "cellular reprogramming." If\r\nsuccessful, this approach would represent a novel way of targeting and\r\npotentially treating cancer.\r\n\r\nHe also hopes to help develop novel sarcoma therapies through use of a\r\npatient- or tumor-centered approach =E2=80=93 a form of personalized or "pr=\r\necision"\r\nmedicine. The technology exists to sequence and establish a genetic\r\nsignature for each patient\'s tumor. With this information, the Division may\r\nbe able to specifically tailor treatment that would most effectively\r\neradicate a patient\'s cancer while minimizing potential side effects. This\r\nis an ongoing project, and Dr. Dela Cruz believes it will be the paradigm\r\nfor future cancer treatments.\r\n\n-', '\n\nHi Mr. Econome,\r\n\r\nThis is the draft sent to me by Dr. Hernandez from SUNY Downstate.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nLeon Cheng\r\n\n-', '\n\nakandola97@gmail.com\r\n\n-', '\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\n\n---------- Forwarded message ----------\r\nFrom: Ivan Hernandez <Ivan.Hernandez@downstate.edu>\r\nDate: Tue, Apr 14, 2015 at 10:42 AM\r\nSubject: Re: Could you please e-mail those papers we discussed so the\r\nstudents have a clearer idea of what their responsibilities would be for\r\nthe summer?\r\nTo: Jason Econome <jgpeconomopolis@gmail.com>\r\nCc: JuanMarcos Alarcon <JuanMarcos.Alarcon@downstate.edu>\r\n\r\n\r\nDear Jason,\r\n\r\nAttached are the articles.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you need anything else\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAlejandro Iv=C3=A1n Hern=C3=A1ndez, PhD\r\nAssistant Professor\r\nDepartment of Pathology\r\nSUNY Downstate Medical Center\r\n450 Clarkson Avenue, Box 25\r\nBrooklyn, New York 11203\r\nivan.hernandez@downstate.edu\r\nPh: 718-270-4561\r\nFAX: 718-270-3313\r\n*(See attached file: Intel_AK v8.pdf)**(See attached file:\r\nintelpaperdraft1.docx)*\r\n[image: Inactive hide details for Could you please e-mail those papers we\r\ndiscussed so the students have a clearer idea of what their r]Could you\r\nplease e-mail those papers we discussed so the students have a clearer idea\r\nof what their responsibilities would b...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n *Could you please e-mail those papers we discussed so the students have a\r\nclearer idea of what their responsibilities would be for the summer?*\r\n\r\n\r\n   *Jason Econome  *\r\n   to:\r\n\r\n   undisclosed-recipients:;\r\n\r\n   04/13/15 05:08 PM\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   From:\r\n\r\n\r\nJason Econome <jgpeconomopolis@gmail.com>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   To:\r\n\r\n\r\nundisclosed-recipients:;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   Bcc:\r\n\r\n\r\nIvan Hernandez/Downstate\r\n\r\nDear Dr. Hernandez and Dr. Alarcon,\r\n\r\nI very much enjoyed our telephone conversation about the summer research\r\nproject.

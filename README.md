# Spockify

## WHY?
Technology has affected the way humans communicate in many different ways. While the decrease in real life socializing may be seen as a negative by some, Spockify is a tool to turn it into a positive. Spockify is a web application that assists emotionally-impaired users in understanding underlying emotions and meanings in messages and gives advice on how to respond accordingly.
